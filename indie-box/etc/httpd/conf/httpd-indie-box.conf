# Apache configuration file modified for Indie Box.
# Most important difference: the configuration is broken into multiple
# directories, so incremental changes can be automated easily.
# DO NOT CHANGE THIS FILE. Updates may overwrite it. Instead, modify
#     /etc/httpd/indie-box/defaults.conf
#     /etc/httpd/indie-box/defaultsite.conf
#     /etc/httpd/indie-box/ssl.conf
#     /etc/httpd/indie-box/usersettings.conf
# if you need to.
